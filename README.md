## ABOUT ME
I have been coding since childhood. The year 2024 will mark a very exciting milestone for me, I will have been coding for over half my life come November. Throughout my life I have worked programming and scripting into virtually everything I do from music, to games, to family, to art, and so many other aspects that I couldn’t hope to enumerate because it is so ubiquitous. 

Having had so much time to build these skills, my goals for growth are grand and uniquely achievable by me. My passion for leadership and collaboration has led me to building a professional team of peers and developing products as a start up. I aim high for roles like DevSecOps engineer, release manager, and other roles that are generally held by more experienced programmers because I honestly place myself on that level; I've come up against what felt at the time like impossible gaps in understanding but have always been able to bridge what I know and what my experience as an excellent student has enabled me to learn as needed. My knowledge base and experiences are vast enough that I can effectively learn new skills and tools as if I had a head start of at least a year working with them. I never shy away from an opportunity to use a new tool or framework, I always dive in and aim to become a champion of the system for my team.
