## ABOUT ME
I have been coding since childhood. The year 2024 will mark a very exciting milestone for me, I will have been coding for over half my life come November. Throughout my life I have worked programming and scripting into virtually everything I do from music, to games, to family, to art, and so many other aspects that I couldn’t hope to enumerate because it is so ubiquitous. 
My passion for leadership and collaboration has led me to building a professional team of peers and developing products as a start up. I aim high because I know that I can rise to the occasion when tasked with a challenge; I've come up against what felt at the time like impossible gaps in understanding but have always been able to bridge what I know and what my experience as an excellent student has enabled me to learn as needed. My knowledge base and experiences are vast enough that I can effectively learn new skills and tools as if I had a head start of at least a year working with them. I never shy away from an opportunity to use a new tool or framework, I always dive in and aim to become a champion of the system for my team.
